when I try to run docker-compose up I get the following error:
ERROR: Version in "./docker-compose.yml" is unsupported. You might be seeing this error because you're using the wrong Compose file version. Either specify a supported version (e.g "2.2" or "3.3") and place your service definitions under the `services` key, or omit the `version` key and place your service definitions at the root of the file to use version 1.

so I change the version from 3.9 to 3.3 and now is working fine.
but in the docker in the mac with 3.9 works fine. 
TODO: I need to address this error asap

after creating a new app named core
wee remove test and views.py because this server will be a rest API.
